### Learning outcome: Coroutines 
- Async functions and coroutines
- What can you await on?
- Awaiting on many things at once
- Tasks: running things "in the background"
- Waiting for background tasks
- Cancelling


- an async function is the definition, it will create coroutines when called
- coroutines in term are awaitable objects that you create by calling async functoins 
- coroutine can be only awaited on once!!!
